<h3>Hot To Cook Nigerian Fried Rice</h3>
<p>Nigerian Fried Rice is a very simple yet delicious recipe  It is perfectly okay to call this recipe 
    West African fried rice because we generally cook fried rice the same way across West Africa  Nigeria,
     Ghana, Cameroon, Togo, Cotonou, etc. This recipe relies  on a ton of fresh vegetables, Beef Liver, 
     and a little bit of oil for crisping it up.</p>

     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <p>Serving: 8 Persons</p>
     <ul>
       <li>4 cups of rice.</li>
       <li>5 cups of sliced Cabbage.</li>
       <li>2 cups of sliced Carrot.</li>
       <li>2 cups of sliced Green beans.</li>
       <li>Half cup of peas.</li>
       <li>1 cup of sliced Green pepper.</li>
       <li>Cow Liver {300g}</li>
       <li>2kg of Chicken.</li>
       <li>1 cup of sliced Onions.</li>
        <li>Curry powder (coloring spice) {2 Tablespoons}</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil.{200ml}</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Parboil chicken and liver (both together) with all the spices (a teaspoon of salt, half cup of sliced onions,
       a teaspoon of thyme spice, a teaspoon of curry, two seasoning cubes teaspoon each of powdered ginger and garlic).
       Allow the meat to cook for ten to fifteen minutes, taste for salt, then pick out and deep-fry. Be sure to reserve 
       the stock (meat water)</li>

       <li>Chop the cabbage, green beans, carrot, liver and set aside in a wide tray as you can find in the video below or the image above.
       This process is easy, I normally use just a knife and chopping board or a tray.</li>

       <li>arboil the 4 cups of rice also and cook with half of the meat stock (water from the meat) and two cups
         of water, cook until it is about 70% done.</li>

         <li>Set your cooking pot on heat, allow drying, then pour in about 200ml of vegetable oil.</li>
         <li>Set your cooking pot on heat, allow drying, then pour in about 200ml of vegetable oil.</li>
         <li>Then add the chopped carrot and green beans, any of these two can actually go first.</li>     
         <li>Add the chopped liver and sweet corn, stir. </li>
         <li>Stir for 1-2 minutes then add cabbage and the curry powder (Curry is a yellowish spice that actually adds the yellowish 
          color to fried rice, add and stir till you are satisfied with the color.)
          You would have a yellowish mixture that would often taste overly spiced, dnot worry the rice would balance the taste.
          If you are satisfied with the taste, then add the green pepper, stir</li> 
          <li>Add the almost-done white rice and stir Stir all together, cover your pot and allow to simmer for 5-7 minutes.
            That is how to make fried rice. serve with meat of choice.
          </li>
